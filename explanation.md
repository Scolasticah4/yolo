# Explanation of the Ansible Playbook

## Reasoning for Order of Execution

In the playbook, the roles are executed sequentially to ensure that each component of the application is set up in a logical order. This sequence is crucial for proper configuration and functionality of the full-stack application. The order is as follows:

1. **MongoDB Role**: Configured first to ensure the database service is available before setting up the backend and client services. MongoDB must be running and accessible for the backend service to interact with it.

2. **Backend Role**: Set up after MongoDB to ensure that the backend application is configured and running once the database is in place. The backend service depends on the MongoDB service, so it must be configured after MongoDB is up and running.

3. **Client Role**: Configured last as it depends on both the backend and MongoDB services. The client interacts with the backend, which in turn requires MongoDB, so the client service should be set up after these dependencies are in place.

## 1. MongoDB Role
**Function:**
The `mongodb` role handles the installation and configuration of MongoDB on the host machine. It ensures MongoDB is properly installed, configured, and running, providing a database service for the backend.

**Tasks:**
1. **Installation:** Uses the `apt` module to install MongoDB packages from the official MongoDB repository.
2. **Configuration:** Uses the `template` module to deploy MongoDB configuration files, which are necessary for setting up the database environment.
3. **Service Management:** Uses the `service` module to ensure the MongoDB service is started and enabled to run on system boot.

**Ansible Modules Applied:**
- **`apt`:** Manages package installation on Debian-based systems.
- **`template`:** Renders and deploys Jinja2 templates to configure MongoDB.
- **`service`:** Manages the MongoDB service to ensure it is running.

## 2. Backend Role
**Function:**
The `backend` role sets up the backend application environment. It involves installing necessary dependencies, configuring the backend service, and ensuring it operates correctly.

**Tasks:**
1. **Installation:** Uses the `apt` module to install required system packages.
2. **Dependency Management:** Uses the `npm` module to install Node.js dependencies specific to the backend application.
3. **Configuration:** Uses the `template` module to deploy backend-specific configuration files.
4. **Service Management:** Uses the `service` module to ensure the backend service is started and operational.

**Ansible Modules Applied:**
- **`apt`:** Manages package installation for backend dependencies.
- **`npm`:** Manages Node.js package installation for backend dependencies.
- **`template`:** Renders and deploys Jinja2 templates for backend configuration.
- **`service`:** Manages the backend service to ensure it is running.

## 3. Client Role
**Function:**
The `client` role handles the setup of the client application environment. It includes installing dependencies, configuring the client service, and ensuring it is up and running.

**Tasks:**
1. **Installation:** Uses the `apt` module to install required system packages.
2. **Dependency Management:** Uses the `npm` module to install Node.js dependencies required for the client application.
3. **Configuration:** Uses the `template` module to deploy configuration files for the client.
4. **Service Management:** Uses the `service` module to ensure the client service is running.

**Ansible Modules Applied:**
- **`apt`:** Manages package installation for client dependencies.
- **`npm`:** Manages Node.js package installation for client dependencies.
- **`template`:** Renders and deploys Jinja2 templates for client configuration.
- **`service`:** Manages the client service to ensure it is operational.

## Summary

The order of execution in the playbook ensures that MongoDB is set up first, providing a reliable database service for the backend. The backend is then configured to interact with MongoDB, followed by the client, which relies on both the backend and database services. Each role uses specific Ansible modules to handle tasks such as package installation, dependency management, configuration, and service management.
